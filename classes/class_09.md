# Class 9 - Exploring BERT-style transformers

Today we will be thinking about how we can explore and interpret transformer models and the attention weights that they learn.

To do that, we'll use a few readymade tools which have been designed to solve this problem. I've provided you with code and links to three different tools, along with some questions and tasks to be working on in small groups.

We'll also have some time at the start to talk about the Notebook from last week, finetuning a pretrained model for a specific task (such as NER).

## Outline

- Discuss any issues related to the notebook last week
- Present notebook for today with tools for exploring and interperting
- Work with the different frameworks
- Gain greater familiarity with the ecosystem surrounding transformers
