# Class 10 - Text generation with Huggingface
## EDIT - And ChatGPT!

In today's class we're going to start with an overview of one final piece of Python which might be new to you, something called _virtual environments_. Using virtual environments allows you to share code easily and have people run it on their machines, avoiding things like dependency clashes and so on. 

Then, we're going to go on to look at how we can use HuggingFace transformers for text generation tasks.

EDIT: A couple of days before this class, OpenAI released a new LLM called ChatGPT. This is still in it's free testing phase, meaning we have unique opportunity to test it in class. So let's do that!
