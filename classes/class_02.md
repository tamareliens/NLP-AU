# Classroom 2 - Basic NLP

This classroom will introduce you one of the most widely-used NLP frameworks in both academia and industry. 

In the lecture this week, we saw that language is not simply just a series of character strings. Instead, language comprises *words* which have their own special properties, such as word class, grammatical relations, and so on. ```spaCy``` is a flexible and user-friendly way of annotating text strings to provide this kind of extra information, in the form of a new data type known as a ```Doc```.

For the rest of this semester, we'll be more interested in the machinary and architecture underlying a tool like ```spaCY``` than using it directly for linguistic analysis of data. But it's good to start by seeing what kind of things are possible with NLP tools, when we have good language models and deep learning frameworks to build on.
