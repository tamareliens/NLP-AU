# Class 7 - Some Python best practices + LSTM assignment

In this classroom, we're going to see some best practices for working with Python. I'll show you some tips and tricks to write better code and to make your code easier to share and reproduce.

After that, there will be time to carry on working on the assignment in class. If you've already completed the assignment - which I don't think is the case for any group right now - you will have time to take some of the best practices that you're learning today and adapt your assignment using these news techniques.

The assignment itself to use all of the skills and tools we've developed in the past few weeks to train a *named entity recogntion* model using recurrent neural networks. More specifically, we'll be using LSTMs and Bi-LSTMs.
