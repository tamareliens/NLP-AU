# Class 4 - Text classification with ```pytorch```

In this class, we're going to build directly on the material we looked at last week. This week, though, we're actually going to start working with text data more directly.

By the end of today, you'll know how to set up a simple pipeline for doing classification with ```pytorch```. You'll also learn the basics of how ```pytorch``` can be used to build increasingly sophisticated architectures for doing NLP.
