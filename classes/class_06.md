# Class 6 - Training an LSTM model for Named Entity Recognition

In this classroom, you'll primarily be working on a series of small tasks all of which are related to the assignment given out this week. With this assignment, we're moving into doing some real NLP. 

Link to the assignment: [https://classroom.github.com/a/T855eJ55](https://classroom.github.com/a/T855eJ55)

The assignment itself to use all of the skills and tools we've developed in the past few weeks to train a *named entity recogntion* model using recurrent neural networks. More specifically, we'll be using LSTMs and Bi-LSTMs.
