# Class 8 - Finetuning BERT and discussing exam projects

In today's class, there will be a number of different activities happening at the same and you're welcome to decide which one you want to work on and in which order.

For those of you who want a bit more clarity, there is a worked solution to Assignment 4 that you can work through, comparing my solution to you solutions.

If you want to improve your assignment code, I've added links to a resource called Weights and Biases which allows you to track models during training. Set up a free account and add the tool to your LSTM code to see how it works.

In the lecture this week, we were introduced to BERT style models and transformer architectures. We'll dig into this in more detail next week but, for now, there is also an example notebook with tasks for you to work on which shows how we can finetune BERT models for specific tasks, such as NER.

While you're working on this, I'll be spending around 10 minutes with each exam group, talking about potential ideas and figuring out next steps in developing exams.

Lots to do!
